June 14th-
I spent some time researching parts, and thought about my idea. I just came up with a rough idea today overall to guide and think upon. I also completed the BOM just now. As well as the PCB layout. I will route it tomorrow.

Today, I changed around the components a bit (ESP32 -> Arduino Nano) and got rid of the switch due to the rotary encoder having one built in. I did the routing for the PCB which took wayyy longer than expected especially with the footprints not working properly so I had like 15 errors. I had to manually edit the footprints but luckily it works now. ![CleanShot 2025-06-15 at 17 11 57](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c7c4b2f-81da-45c3-a09c-8e547b2c4976)
