# Reed-Machine
Ever opened a new reed but it just felt stiff? That's the purpose of the Reed Machine; to speed up the break-in process so you can swap reeds quickly as well as get current reeds in better shape. The Reed Machine will send various types of energy throughout the reed to break it in faster. Sometimes, my current reed breaks at the wrong times and having a little machine that prepares my next reed for me just sitting in my case would be great.
